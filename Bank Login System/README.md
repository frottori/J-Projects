# Bank Login System
A simple Bank Login System with pre-existing UserAccounts and the ability to add new ones while the program is running, you can deposit or withdraw money from each account. If you withdraw a money amount bigger than the account's balance an error message will pop out asking if you're sure you want to be in debt.
The main function is contained on the LoginPage.java
